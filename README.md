# Friday-Project-Due-2-25
This repo includes AI generated versions of the past three Friday projects. 

The MadlibAI.py program collects user input for various prompts and utilizes the information to dynamically construct a descriptive paragraph. It then outputs the personalized paragraph, providing a playful and interactive experience by incorporating the user's input into a predefined narrative structure.
    The steps include:
        Get user input.
        Create a paragraph without f-string.
        Print paragraph.

The PowerballAI.py program asks the user if they want Powerball numbers. If yes, it generates 5 random main numbers (1-69) and 1 Powerball number (1-26), displaying them. If no, it prints "Maybe next time."
    The steps include:
        Ask user if they want Powerball numbers.
        Check user's response.
        Generate 5 random numbers from 1 to 69.
        Generate 1 random number from 1 to 26.
        Display the generated numbers with commas and spaces.
